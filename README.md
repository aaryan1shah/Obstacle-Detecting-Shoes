The prototype of Obstacle Detecting Shoes for Blind People is a project that aims to improve the mobility of visually impaired individuals. The project uses an Arduino microcontroller, ultrasonic sensors, and a vibrating module to detect obstacles in the user's path and provide tactile feedback to the user.

The ultrasonic sensor is mounted on the front of the shoe and sends out sound waves that bounce off nearby objects. The sensor then measures the time it takes for the sound waves to bounce back, which allows the Arduino to calculate the distance to the obstacle.

If an obstacle is detected within 0.5 meters of the user, the vibrating module on the shoe will vibrate to alert the user. The intensity of the vibration corresponds to the proximity of the obstacle, providing the user with a sense of how close they are to the obstacle.

The Obstacle Detecting Shoes for Blind People project is designed to improve the safety and independence of visually impaired individuals. By alerting the user to obstacles in their path, the shoes can help prevent accidents and provide greater freedom of movement.

This project can be further developed to include additional features such as GPS and voice recognition to help guide the user to a specific destination or provide additional information about their surroundings.
